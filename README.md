Emotional computing technology, which enables machines to understand human emotions, is becoming a research hotspot in the fields of human-computer interaction, mental health and artificial intelligence. Compared with speech, expression, heart rate and other behaviors and peripheral physiological signals, EEG can directly reflect individual emotional experience information, and EEG emotional computing/emotional brain-computer interface has been widely concerned by academic circles in recent years.
Due to the individual differences in emotional experience, how to realize cross-individual robust emotional recognition has always been a major challenge for the practical application of EEG emotional computing/emotional brain-computer interface (Hu et al. 2019). Facing this challenge, this contest provides participants with a batch of EEG data from 80 subjects with known emotional state information. Participants are required to establish an EEG calculation model with cross-individual emotional recognition ability, conduct real-time emotional recognition on another batch of subjects' EEG data, and determine the competition results according to the accuracy of emotional recognition.
